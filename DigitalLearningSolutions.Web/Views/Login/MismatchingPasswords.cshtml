      We've recently changed how we store user accounts, so that you can switch between centres while logged in.
    </p>
    <p class="nhsuk-body-l">
      Some of your accounts have different passwords.
      For your security, you must reset your password before you can log in.
      Once you have reset your password and verified your email address,
      logging in with your new password will give you access to all of your centres.
